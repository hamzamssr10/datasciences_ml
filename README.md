## 🔍 1. **Problem Definition**

* Understand the business or research problem.
* Define the objective clearly (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
* Identify stakeholders and what they expect from the project.

---

## 📊 2. **Data Collection**

* Gather raw data from various sources:

  * Internal databases (SQL, Excel, etc.)
  * APIs
  * Web scraping
  * Sensors or IoT devices
  * Public datasets (Kaggle, UCI, etc.)

---

## 🧹 3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

* Handle missing values (impute, drop, etc.)
* Remove duplicates
* Fix inconsistencies (e.g., unit mismatch, typos)
* Convert data types (e.g., string to date)
* Filter outliers or anomalies

---

## 📐 4. **Data Exploration (EDA)**

* Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, std, etc.)
* Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps)
* Detect patterns, trends, correlations
* Understand feature distributions and relationships

---

## 🔧 5. **Feature Engineering**

* Create new features from existing ones (e.g., date → weekday)
* Encode categorical variables (One-Hot, Label Encoding)
* Normalize or standardize numerical features
* Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE if needed)
* Feature selection (correlation analysis, importance ranking)

---

## 🤖 6. **Model Selection**

* Choose appropriate model(s) based on the problem:

  * Classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  * Regression (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting)
  * Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
  * NLP, Time Series, etc.
* Split data: training, validation, testing (commonly 70/15/15)

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ 7. **Model Training**

* Train the model on the training dataset
* Use cross-validation to ensure generalization
* Tune hyperparameters (Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization)

---

## 📈 8. **Model Evaluation**

* Evaluate using appropriate metrics:

  * Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC
  * Regression: MAE, RMSE, R²
  * Clustering: Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin index
* Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Residual plots

---

## 🧪 9. **Model Validation and Testing**

* Test the model on the test set (data never seen during training)
* Ensure no data leakage
* Compare multiple models if necessary

---

## 🚀 10. **Deployment**

* Package the model (pickle, joblib, ONNX, etc.)
* Develop an API (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask)
* Deploy on a server, cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP, Heroku)
* Connect to the frontend, app, or production system

---

## 📡 11. **Monitoring & Maintenance**

* Track performance over time (drift detection, real-time metrics)
* Log predictions, input data, and system errors
* Set alerts for anomalies or degraded performance
* Schedule periodic model re-training (especially in dynamic environments)

---

## 📄 12. **Documentation & Reporting**

* Document:

  * Data sources and schema
  * Data preprocessing pipeline
  * Feature engineering techniques
  * Model performance and tuning
  * Deployment setup
* Prepare reports or dashboards for stakeholders (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, or custom dashboards)

---

## 🔁 13. **Iteration**

* Re-collect or augment data based on feedback
* Try alternative algorithms
* Improve preprocessing, features, or deployment pipeline
